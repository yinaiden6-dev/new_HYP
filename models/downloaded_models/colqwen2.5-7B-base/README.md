# ColQwen2.5: Visual Retriever based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct with ColBERT strategy

ColQwen is a model based on a novel model architecture and training strategy based on Vision Language Models (VLMs) to efficiently index documents from their visual features.
It is a [Qwen2.5-VL-3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) extension that generates [ColBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832)- style multi-vector representations of text and images. 
It was introduced in the paper [ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449) and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/ManuelFay/colpali)

This version is the untrained base version to guarantee deterministic projection layer initialization.


## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> This version should not be used: it is solely the base version useful for deterministic LoRA initialization.
